"""Domain Services for the Authentication Bounded Context.

This module provides clean access to all domain services following DDD principles.
All services implement the single responsibility principle and use dependency injection
through interfaces for loose coupling and testability.

Authentication Domain Services:
- User Authentication: Core authentication logic with security features
- User Registration: User account creation and validation
- User Logout: Session termination and token revocation
- Password Management: Password change and reset operations
- OAuth Integration: Third-party authentication providers
- Token Management: JWT token lifecycle management
- Email Confirmation: Email confirmation workflow management

Security Domain Services:
- Password Policy: Business rules for password strength and validation
- Policy Management: Authorization policies with ABAC support and audit trails

Email and Reset Services:
- Email Service: Template rendering and email delivery
- Password Reset: Request and completion workflows
- Email Confirmation: Request and completion workflows
